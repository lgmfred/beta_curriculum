## Task Drills

Drills help you develop familiarity and muscle memory with syntax through repeated exercises. Unlike usual problems, Drills are not intended to develop problem solving skills, they are purely for developing comfort and speed.

This set of drills is for [Tasks](../reading/task.livemd). Follow the instructions for each drill and complete them as quickly as you can.

## Task.await/2

Use [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1) and [Task.await/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#await/2) to spawn a task process that returns any response.

```elixir

```

Use [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1) and [Task.await/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#await/2) to spawn a task process that sleeps for six seconds. It should cause a timeout error.

```elixir

```

Use [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1) and [Task.await/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#await/2) to spawn a task process that sleeps for six seconds. Provide a timeout value to [Task.await/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#await/2) so that it properly awaits the response.

```elixir

```

## Task.yield/2

Use [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1) and [Task.yield/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#yield/2) to spawn a task process that returns any response.

### Slow Operation

```elixir
# 1000 operations
{time, _result} = :timer.tc(fn -> Enum.map(1..10, fn int -> Process.sleep(1000) end) end)
time
```

```elixir
{time, _result} =
  :timer.tc(fn ->
    # 1000 tasks
    # 1000 operations -> parallel
    tasks =
      Enum.map(1..10, fn int ->
        Task.async(fn ->
          IO.puts("starting task #{int}")
          Process.sleep(1000)
        end)
      end)

    Task.await_many(tasks)
  end)

```

### Fast Operation

```elixir
# 1000 operations
{time, _result} = :timer.tc(fn -> Enum.map(1..10, fn int -> int * 2 end) end)
time
```

```elixir
{time, _result} =
  :timer.tc(fn ->
    # 1000 tasks
    # 1000 operations -> parallel
    tasks = Enum.map(1..10, fn int -> Task.async(fn -> int * 2 end) end)
    Task.await_many(tasks)
  end)
```

Use [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1) and [Task.yield/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#yield/2) to spawn a task process that sleeps for six seconds and returns any response. Notice that the yield is `nil`.

```elixir

```

Use [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1) and [Task.yield/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#yield/2) to spawn a task process that sleeps for six seconds and returns any response. Provide a timeout value to [Task.yield/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#yield/2) so that it properly returns the response.

```elixir

```

Use [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1), [Task.yield/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#yield/2), and [Task.shutdown/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#shutdown/2) to spawn a task process that sleeps for six seconds. Shutdown the task process if it does not yield any value.

```elixir

```

## Task.await_many/2

Use [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1) and [Task.await_many/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#await_many/2) to spawn two task processes that both return a random number from `1..10`.

```elixir

```

Use [Enum.map/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#map/2), [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1), and [Task.await_many/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#await_many/2) to spawn one hundred task processes that all return a random integer from `1..100`.

```elixir

```

Use [Enum.map/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#map/2), [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1), and [Task.await_many/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#await_many/2) to spawn one hundred task processes that return a list doubled numbers from one to one hundred. i.e. `[2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 198, 200]`.

```elixir

```

Use [Enum.map/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#map/2), [Task.async/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#async/1), [String.upcase/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#upcase/2), and [Task.await_many/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#await_many/2) to concurrently capitalize every string in the list `["apple", "pear", "peaches"]`

```elixir

```

## Task.Supervisor

Start a [Supervisor](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html) with a child `Task.Supervisor` process named `MyTaskSupervisor`. You will use `MyTaskSupervisor` in all of the examples below that need a task supervisor.

```elixir
children = [
  {Task.Supervisor, name: MyTaskSupervisor}
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

Use `Task.Supervisor.async/3` and [Task.await/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#await/2) to start a supervised task process that returns a random number after sleeping for two seconds.

```elixir

```

Use [Enum.map/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#map/2), `Task.Supervisor.async/3` and [Task.await_many/2](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html#await_many/2) to start one hundred supervised task processes that returns a list of doubled numbers from one `1..100`. i.e. `[2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 198, 200]`.

```elixir

```

Use `Task.Supervisor.start_child/3` to start a `:temporary` task that crashes after five seconds. `:temporary` is already the default `:restart` option.

Use [Supervisor.which_children/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#which_children/1) after six seconds to demonstrate that a `:temporary` process is not restarted.

```elixir

```

Use `Task.Supervisor.start_child/3` with the `restart: :transient` option to start a `:transient` task that crashes after five seconds.

Use [Supervisor.which_children/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#which_children/1) after six seconds to demonstrate that the `:transient` process is restarted.

```elixir

```
