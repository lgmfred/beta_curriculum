## Book Changeset

You're going to create a `Book` schemaless changeset struct. A book should have:

* A required `:title` field between `3` and `100` characters.
* A required `:content` string field.
* A required `:published_status` field that is either `true` or `false`.
* A `:published_on` date field which must exist if the `:published_status` is `true`.
* An `:author` string field.
* An `:is_licenced` field which must always be true.
  It's common for applications to have a sign up form that validates a user's email, password, and other information.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
{:ok, book} =
  Book.new(%{
    title: "Name of the Wind",
    content: "My name is Kvothe. I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings...",
    published_status: true,
    published_on: ~D[2007-03-27],
    is_licenced: true
  })
```

You should rely on Ecto Changesets and your own custom validation to validate the user information.
Enter your solution below.

```elixir
defmodule Book do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  def changeset(%Book{} = user, params) do
  end

  def new(params) do
  end
end
```
