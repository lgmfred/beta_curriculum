## Kitchen Queue

A FIFO (First In First Out) queue is a common pattern in programming with many applications.

FIFO is also a common term when managing inventory, meaning that older
items should be consumed before newer products.

We're going to apply the concept of a FIFO queue and build a kitchen management game.
Customer requests will be received, and saved in-memory.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Kitchen.request("burger with fries")
Kitchen.request("caesar salad")
```

Then the kitchen can prepare the oldest request in the queue.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
"burger with fries" = Kitchen.prepare()
"caesar salad" = Kitchen.prepare()
```

You might consider using either a named [Agent](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Agent.html), `:ets`, or [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html) process to save the queue in-memory.
You may need to start a named process before calling the `Kitchen` module.

```elixir
defmodule Kitchen do
  def request(item) do
  end

  def prepare() do
  end
end
```

Test your solution by uncommenting and executing the code below.

```elixir
# Kitchen.request("burger with fries")
# Kitchen.request("caesar salad")
# "burger with fries" = Kitchen.prepare()
# "caesar salad" = Kitchen.prepare()
```

## Kitchen Stock Application

Happy with our previous work, we are asked to build an inventory management system for the kitchen stock.
Items in a kitchen are stored under a common `:name` and a unique `:id`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Stock.store(%{name: :carton_of_eggs, id: 1})
Stock.store(%{name: :carton_of_eggs, id: 2})
```

We should be able to retrieve an item by it's name, and return the oldest items first.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
%{name: :carton_of_eggs, id: 1} = Stock.retrieve(:carton_of_eggs)
%{name: :carton_of_eggs, id: 2} = Stock.retrieve(:carton_of_eggs)
```

There are many valid solutions, but you
might consider using a named `:ets` table with the `:bag` configuration.

You may need to start a named process before calling the `Stock` module.

Enter your solution below.

```elixir
defmodule Stock do
  def store(item) do
  end

  def retrieve(item_name) do
  end
end
```

Test your solution by uncommenting and executing the code below.

```elixir
# Stock.store(%{name: :carton_of_eggs, id: 1})
# Stock.store(%{name: :carton_of_eggs, id: 2})
# %{name: :carton_of_eggs, id: 1} = Stock.retrieve(:carton_of_eggs)
# %{name: :carton_of_eggs, id: 2} = Stock.retrieve(:carton_of_eggs)
```
