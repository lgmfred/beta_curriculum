## Create A New Mix Project

Using the command line, create a new project called `games`.

```
mix new games
```

We're going to use this project to build several different games.

Initialize the project with git. Make sure it is not already in a git managed folder.

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initialize mix project"
```

You should create a [new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new) for this project so that you can push your changes and manage it using source control.

progress_path = __DIR__ <> "/../progress.json"
existing_progress = File.read!(progress_path) |> Jason.decode!()

form =
  Kino.Control.form(
    [
      completed: input = Kino.Input.checkbox("Mark As Completed", default: default)
    ],
    report_changes: true
  )

Task.async(fn ->
  for %{data: %{completed: completed}} <- Kino.Control.stream(form) do
    File.write!(progress_path, Jason.encode!(Map.put(existing_progress, file_name, completed)))
  end
end)

form
```
